## Features

OSMMCP offers a range of features to support your geospatial needs:

- **Geocoding**: Convert addresses into geographic coordinates and vice versa.
- **Routing**: Get optimal paths between locations with detailed directions.
- **Nearby Places**: Discover points of interest based on your location.
- **Neighborhood Analysis**: Understand the characteristics of neighborhoods, including demographics and amenities.
- **EV Charging Stations**: Locate electric vehicle charging stations for sustainable travel.

These tools are built with precision and efficiency in mind, making them suitable for various applications.

## Installation

To set up OSMMCP, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/estebamod/osmmcp.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd osmmcp
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   ./osmmcp
   ```

After running the server, you can access the tools via the specified endpoints.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use the various features. Here‚Äôs a quick overview:

### Geocoding

To geocode an address, send a request to the `/geocode` endpoint:

```http
GET /geocode?address=Your+Address
```

### Routing

To find a route, use the `/route` endpoint:

```http
GET /route?from=Start+Location&to=End+Location
```

### Nearby Places

To find nearby places, access the `/nearby` endpoint:

```http
GET /nearby?location=Latitude,Longitude
```

### Neighborhood Analysis

For neighborhood insights, use the `/neighborhood` endpoint:

```http
GET /neighborhood?location=Latitude,Longitude
```

### EV Charging Stations

To locate EV charging stations, send a request to the `/ev-charging` endpoint:

```http
GET /ev-charging?location=Latitude,Longitude
```

These endpoints allow you to integrate powerful geospatial functionalities into your applications.
