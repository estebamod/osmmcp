# OpenStreetMap MCP Server (Go Implementation)

[![Go](https://github.com/NERVsystems/osmmcp/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NERVsystems/osmmcp/actions/workflows/go.yml)

This is a Go implementation of the OpenStreetMap MCP server that enhances LLM capabilities with location-based services and geospatial data.

## Overview

This is a Go OpenStreetMap MCP server.  It implemets the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go) to enable LLMs to interact with geospatial data.

Our focus focus on precision, performance, maintainability, and ease of integration with MCP desktop clients.

## Features

The server provides LLMs with tools to interact with OpenStreetMap data, including:

* Geocoding addresses and place names to coordinates
* Reverse geocoding coordinates to addresses
* Finding nearby points of interest
* Getting route directions between locations
* Searching for places by category within a bounding box
* Suggesting optimal meeting points for multiple people
* Exploring areas and getting comprehensive location information
* Finding EV charging stations near a location
* Finding EV charging stations along a route
* Analyzing commute options between home and work
* Performing neighborhood livability analysis
* Finding schools near a location
* Finding parking facilities

## Improved Geocoding Tools

The geocoding tools have been enhanced to provide more reliable results and better error handling:

### Key Improvements

- **Smart Address Preprocessing**: Automatically sanitizes inputs to improve success rates
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Returns structured error responses with error codes and helpful suggestions
- **Better Diagnostics**: Provides detailed logging to track geocoding issues
- **Improved Formatting Guide**: Documentation with specific examples of what works well

### Best Practices for Geocoding

For optimal results when using the geocoding tools:

1. **Simplify complex queries**: 
   - Bad: "Blue Temple (Wat Rong Suea Ten) in Chiang Rai"
   - Good: "Blue Temple Chiang Rai Thailand"

2. **Add geographic context**: 
   - Bad: "Eiffel Tower"
   - Good: "Eiffel Tower, Paris, France"

3. **Read error suggestions**: 
   - Our enhanced error responses include specific suggestions for fixing failed queries

See the [Geocoding Tools Guide](pkg/tools/docs/geocoding.md) for comprehensive documentation and [AI Prompts for Geocoding](pkg/tools/docs/ai_prompts.md) for examples of how to guide AI systems in using these tools effectively.

## Code Architecture and Design

The code follows software engineering best practices:

1. **High Cohesion, Low Coupling** - Each package has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Separation of Concerns** - Tools, server logic, and utilities are cleanly separated
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Common utilities are extracted into the `pkg/osm` package
4. **Security First** - HTTP clients are properly configured with timeouts and connection limits
5. **Structured Logging** - All logging is done via `slog` with consistent levels and formats:
   - Debug: Developer detail, verbose or diagnostic messages
   - Info: Routine operational messages
   - Warn: Unexpected conditions that don't necessarily halt execution
   - Error: Critical problems, potential or actual failures
6. **SOLID Principles** - Particularly Single Responsibility and Interface Segregation
7. **Registry Pattern** - All tools are defined in a central registry for improved maintainability
8. **Google Polyline5 Format** - Standardized polyline encoding/decoding using Google's Polyline5 format
9. **Precise Geospatial Calculations** - Accurate Haversine distance calculations with appropriate tolerances
10. **Context-Aware Operations** - All operations properly handle context for cancellation and timeouts

## Usage

### Requirements

- Go 1.24 or higher
- OpenStreetMap API access (no API key required, but rate limits apply)

### Building the server

```bash
go build -o osmmcp ./cmd/osmmcp
```

### Running the server

```bash
./osmmcp
```

The server supports several command-line flags:

```bash
# Show version information
./osmmcp --version

# Enable debug logging
./osmmcp --debug

# Generate a Claude Desktop Client configuration file
./osmmcp --generate-config /path/to/config.json

# Customize rate limits (requests per second)
./osmmcp --nominatim-rps 1.0 --nominatim-burst 1
./osmmcp --overpass-rps 1.0 --overpass-burst 1
./osmmcp --osrm-rps 1.0 --osrm-burst 1

# Set custom User-Agent string
./osmmcp --user-agent "MyApp/1.0"
```

### Logging Configuration

The server uses structured logging via `slog` with the following configuration:

- Debug level: Enabled with `--debug` flag
- Default level: Info
- Format: Text-based with key-value pairs
- Output: Standard error (stderr)

Example log output:
```
2024-03-14T10:15:30.123Z INFO starting OpenStreetMap MCP server version=0.1.0 log_level=info user_agent=osm-mcp-server/0.1.0
2024-03-14T10:15:30.124Z DEBUG rate limiter initialized service=nominatim rps=1.0 burst=1
```

The server will start and listen for MCP requests on the standard input/output. You can use it with any MCP-compatible client or LLM integration.

### Using with Claude Desktop Client

This MCP server is designed to work with Claude Desktop Client. You can set it up easily with the following steps:

1. Build the server:
   ```bash
   go build -o osmmcp ./cmd/osmmcp
   ```

2. Generate or update the Claude Desktop Client configuration:
   ```bash
   ./osmmcp --generate-config ~/Library/Application\ Support/Anthropic/Claude/config.json
   ```

   This will add an `OSM` entry to the `mcpServers` configuration in Claude Desktop Client. The configuration system intelligently:
   
   - Creates the file if it doesn't exist
   - Preserves existing tools when updating the configuration
   - Uses absolute paths to ensure Claude can find the executable
   - Validates JSON output to prevent corruption

3. Restart Claude Desktop Client to load the updated configuration.

4. In a conversation with Claude, you can now use the OpenStreetMap MCP tools.

The configuration file will look similar to this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "OSM": {
      "command": "/path/to/osmmcp",
      "args": []
    },
  }
}
```

### API Dependencies

The server relies on these external APIs:

- **Nominatim** - For geocoding operations
- **Overpass API** - For OpenStreetMap data queries
- **OSRM** - For routing calculations

No API keys are required as these are open public APIs, but the server follows usage policies including proper user agent identification and request rate limiting.

## Development

### Project Structure

- `cmd/osmmcp` - Main application entry point
- `pkg/server` - MCP server implementation
- `pkg/tools` - OpenStreetMap tool implementations and tool registry
- `pkg/osm` - Common OpenStreetMap utilities and helpers
- `pkg/geo` - Geographic types and calculations 
- `pkg/cache` - Caching layer for API responses

### Adding New Tools

To add a new tool:

1. Implement the tool functions in a new or existing file in `pkg/tools`
2. Add the tool definition to the registry in `pkg/tools/registry.go`

The registry-based design makes it easy to add new tools without modifying multiple files. All tool definitions are centralized in one place, making the codebase more maintainable.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors about redeclared types or functions, you might have older files from previous implementations. Check for and remove any conflicting files:

```bash
# Check for specialized.go which might conflict with newer implementations
rm -f pkg/tools/specialized.go pkg/tools/specialized_*.go

# Check for mock.go which might contain test implementations
rm -f pkg/tools/mock.go
```
